# `/scripts`: README

Nearly all scripts are in a perpetual state of incompletion. The severity of that does vary, but I don't see the benefit in documenting it.

## Descriptions of scripts

__ansicolors.sh:__ Print a demonstration of various colors defined by the ANSI escape code standard.

__braille.sh:__ Something about constructing Braille characters from an array of points.

__center.sh(x):__ Output a provided text centered horizontally across the screen.

__firstfew.py:__ Highlight the first few letters of a provided set of words.

__kittycannon.sh:__ Continuously summon a `kitty`.

__spinner.sh:__ Print a loading spinner using Braille characters.

### still-alive.sh

```
This was a triumph.
I'm making a note here:
HUGE SUCCESS.
It's hard to overstate
my satisfaction.
```
